# Cognition Final Project

Mapping neural activation to semantic representations using fMRI data.

## Notebooks

* **part\_1\_structured\_tasks.ipynb**
 Implements the structured tasks.

* **task3.ipynb**
 Implements the third structured task - an encoding analysis, predicting voxel-wise activation patterns from sentence embeddings using linear regression, comparing GloVe and   BERT.

* **open\_task.ipynb**
 Implements the open-ended tasks.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cohen-or-github/cognition_final_project.git
cd cognition_final_project
```

Open and run each notebook in order to reproduce all decoding results and visualizations.

## Highlights

* Performance comparison across embedding types and tasks
* Intuitive evaluation using decoding metrics (rank / rank accuracy)
* Open Task Analysis: Investigated whether different semantic topics are preferentially encoded in distinct brain networks by combining topic-level fMRI activations with anatomical masks and unsupervised clustering.
